                Hi there, I'm Luis. I'm a software engineer, and I love to cook. 
                I created this site to share my cooking adventures with you. I 
                will admit presentation is not my strong suit, but by the end 
                of the day, it's all about the taste. I hope you enjoy the 
                recipes and start your own cooking adventures too. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the recipes I share here are in form of picture, recipe, 
                and personal ramble, so feel free to skip the last section if 
                you desire. Also I will often give credit to where I got the 
                inspiration from, as we should share one another's love for food.
            </p>
